# Membase for Claude — Persistent Knowledge Database Pattern

**A pattern for giving Claude Code persistent, version-controlled, self-auditing project memory using an append-only SQLite database.**

> This pattern was developed across 125+ sessions on a commercial SaaS project (Agent Red Customer Experience). It evolved from markdown-only memory into a structured database with 8 managed artifact types after discovering that markdown backlogs drift, context windows forget, and session boundaries lose state. The approach below is extractable to any project.

---

## The Problem

Claude Code sessions have three persistent memory challenges:

1. **Context window saturation** — Long sessions accumulate stale context that biases decisions.
2. **Session boundary amnesia** — Each new session starts cold. CLAUDE.md and MEMORY.md help, but they are unstructured and drift over time.
3. **Undetected regression** — When code changes break previously-verified behavior, there is no automated signal unless you have tests that specifically check for it.

The markdown-only approach (CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md + topic files) works well for the first ~20 sessions. After that, the files grow unwieldy, contradictions accumulate, and there is no machine-verifiable way to know if what Claude "remembers" is still true.

---

## Architecture Overview

```
project/
  CLAUDE.md                    # Rules & behavior (HOW to work)
  memory/MEMORY.md             # State & bootstrap (WHAT has been done)
  tools/knowledge-db/
    db.py                      # Append-only SQLite API (~1,900 lines)
    knowledge.db               # The database (auto-created)
    seed.py                    # Initial data loader
    assertions.py              # Machine-verifiable checks (~280 lines)
    app.py                     # Read-only web UI (~260 lines)
  .claude/
    hooks/
      assertion-check.py       # SessionStart hook: run assertions + inject handoff
      scheduler.py             # UserPromptSubmit hook: process scheduled prompts
      spec-classifier.py       # UserPromptSubmit hook: detect specification language (GOV-09)
    settings.local.json        # Hook registration
    SCHEDULE.md                # Pre-planned prompts (FIFO queue)
```

### Foundational Principles

1. **Append-only change control** — No rows are ever updated or deleted. Every change creates a new versioned record with `changed_by`, `changed_at`, and `change_reason`. Current state = latest version per ID (via SQL views).
2. **No phantom artifacts** — If Claude references something, it must exist. If it exists, it must be under change control. If it is under change control, its history must be retrievable.
3. **Machine-verifiable assertions** — Specifications can carry grep/glob assertions. "Claude remembers" becomes "Claude proves."
4. **Never-delete retention** — At ~20 KB/session, storage supports ~57,000 years at 1 session/day. Never purge data.

---

## Step 1: Artifact System Design

The database stores **8 managed artifact types** and **2 supporting record types**. Start with the core 3 (specifications, operational procedures, assertion runs) and add more as your project grows.

### Core Tables (Start Here)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `specifications` | Requirements — testable descriptions of system behavior |
| `operational_procedures` | SOPs, deployment procedures, repeatable processes |
| `assertion_runs` | History of machine-verifiable assertion executions |
| `session_prompts` | Event-sourced session handoff prompts |

### Extended Tables (Add When Needed)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `tests` | Individual test artifacts linked to specifications |
| `test_plans` + `test_plan_phases` | Orchestrating artifact: ordered test phases with gate criteria |
| `work_items` | Units of work: regression, defect, or new capability |
| `backlog_snapshots` | Point-in-time snapshots of active work items |
| `documents` | General-purpose project knowledge (migrated topic files, guides) |
| `environment_config` | Environment-specific values under change control |
| `test_coverage` | Many-to-many test-to-spec mapping |

### Key Design Decisions

#### Versioning Pattern (All Tables Follow This)

```sql
CREATE TABLE specifications (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "SPEC-0245" or "245.1" for sub-specs
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    priority TEXT,                 -- e.g. "P0", "P1", "P2"
    scope TEXT,                    -- grouping / module scope
    section TEXT,                  -- logical section within the project
    handle TEXT,                   -- short mnemonic (e.g. "max-turns-align")
    tags TEXT,                     -- JSON array of tags for filtering
    type TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'requirement',  -- requirement | governance | protected_behavior
    status TEXT NOT NULL,          -- specified | implemented | verified | retired
    assertions TEXT,               -- JSON array of machine-verifiable checks
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,      -- 'claude', 'seed', or session ID
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,      -- ISO 8601 UTC
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,   -- Human-readable explanation
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);

-- Current state = latest version per ID (SQL view)
CREATE VIEW current_specifications AS
SELECT s.* FROM specifications s
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT id, MAX(version) AS max_v
    FROM specifications GROUP BY id
) m ON s.id = m.id AND s.version = m.max_v;
```

#### Specification Types

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `requirement` | Business requirement — "would a different choice affect the customer or the business?" |
| `governance` | Process rules — GOV-01 through GOV-11 (how the human-AI team works) |
| `protected_behavior` | Machine-verifiable assertions that must always pass |

#### Tests Table (Spec-Linked)

```sql
CREATE TABLE tests (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "TEST-0001"
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    spec_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- links to specifications.id
    test_type TEXT NOT NULL,       -- unit | integration | e2e | security | regression | performance
    test_file TEXT,                -- file path
    test_class TEXT,
    test_function TEXT,
    description TEXT,
    expected_outcome TEXT NOT NULL,
    last_result TEXT,              -- PASS | FAIL | null
    last_executed_at TEXT,
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);
```

#### Test Plans (Orchestrating Artifact)

An orchestrating artifact contains ordering, criteria, and execution context. It references other artifacts by ID **without duplicating their content**. Each referenced artifact is independently managed and versioned.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_plans (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "PLAN-001"
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    status TEXT NOT NULL,          -- active | completed | retired
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);

CREATE TABLE test_plan_phases (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "PHASE-001"
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    plan_id TEXT NOT NULL,         -- links to test_plans.id
    phase_order INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    gate_criteria TEXT NOT NULL,   -- what must pass to proceed
    test_ids TEXT,                 -- JSON array of test IDs in this phase
    last_result TEXT,
    last_executed_at TEXT,
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);
```

#### Work Items (Origin + Component Taxonomy)

```sql
CREATE TABLE work_items (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,              -- e.g. "WI-001"
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    origin TEXT NOT NULL,          -- regression | defect | new
    component TEXT NOT NULL,       -- e.g. infrastructure, database, customer_interface
    source_spec_id TEXT,           -- what spec is this about?
    source_test_id TEXT,           -- what test revealed it?
    failure_description TEXT,
    resolution_status TEXT NOT NULL, -- open | in_progress | resolved | wont_fix
    priority TEXT,
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);
```

#### Documents (General Knowledge)

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    rowid INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    id TEXT NOT NULL,
    version INTEGER NOT NULL,
    title TEXT NOT NULL,
    category TEXT,                 -- e.g. "architecture", "operational", "reference"
    content TEXT NOT NULL,
    source_file TEXT,              -- original file path if migrated from markdown
    changed_by TEXT NOT NULL,
    changed_at TEXT NOT NULL,
    change_reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    UNIQUE(id, version)
);
```

### Indexes

Add indexes on frequently-queried columns for performance as the database grows:

```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_id ON specifications(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_status ON specifications(status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_version ON specifications(id, version);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_specs_changed_at ON specifications(changed_at);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_assertion_runs_spec ON assertion_runs(spec_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tests_id ON tests(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_tests_spec ON tests(spec_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_test_plans_id ON test_plans(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_work_items_id ON work_items(id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_work_items_status ON work_items(resolution_status);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_session_prompts_session ON session_prompts(session_id);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_documents_id ON documents(id);
```

### Python API Pattern

```python
class KnowledgeDB:
    """Append-only knowledge database. Claude is the sole writer."""

    AUDIT_INTERVAL = 5  # every Nth session is an audit

    _UNSET = object()  # Sentinel: distinguishes "not provided" from "set to None"

    def __init__(self, db_path=None):
        self.db_path = db_path or Path(__file__).parent / "knowledge.db"
        self._conn = None
        self._ensure_schema()

    def _get_conn(self):
        if self._conn is None:
            self._conn = sqlite3.connect(str(self.db_path))
            self._conn.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
            self._conn.execute("PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL")  # Safe for concurrent reads
        return self._conn

    def get_spec(self, spec_id):
        """Get latest version of a spec."""
        row = self._get_conn().execute(
            "SELECT * FROM current_specifications WHERE id = ?", (spec_id,)
        ).fetchone()
        return dict(row) if row else None

    def insert_spec(self, id, title, status, changed_by, change_reason,
                    type="requirement", **kwargs):
        """Insert a new spec (version 1)."""
        ...

    def update_spec(self, spec_id, changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Create new version with changes. Append-only -- never modifies existing rows."""
        current = self.get_spec(spec_id)
        if not current:
            raise ValueError(f"Spec {spec_id} not found")
        next_version = current["version"] + 1
        # Merge: use new value if provided (via _UNSET sentinel), else keep current
        ...

    def insert_test(self, id, title, spec_id, test_type, expected_outcome,
                    changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Insert a new test artifact linked to a specification."""
        ...

    def insert_test_plan(self, id, title, status, changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Insert a new test plan."""
        ...

    def insert_work_item(self, id, title, origin, component, resolution_status,
                         changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Insert a new work item."""
        ...

    def insert_document(self, id, title, content, changed_by, change_reason, **kwargs):
        """Insert a project knowledge document."""
        ...

    def get_summary(self):
        """Counts by status for all artifact types."""
        ...

    def get_open_work_items(self):
        """All work items with resolution_status = open."""
        ...

    def get_untested_specs(self):
        """Specs with no linked test artifacts."""
        ...

    def get_active_test_plan(self):
        """The currently active test plan and its phases."""
        ...

    def create_backlog_snapshot_from_current(self, changed_by, change_reason):
        """Snapshot all open work items into a backlog record."""
        ...

    def export_json(self, output_path=None):
        """Full logical backup as JSON. Safe to run anytime."""
        ...

    def close(self):
        if self._conn:
            self._conn.close()
            self._conn = None
```

### Usage in Claude Sessions

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "tools/knowledge-db")
from db import KnowledgeDB

db = KnowledgeDB()
db.get_spec("SPEC-0245")                  # Latest version of spec
db.get_summary()                           # Counts by status across all types
db.get_open_work_items()                   # Active work
db.get_untested_specs()                    # Coverage gaps
db.update_spec("SPEC-0245", changed_by="claude",
               change_reason="Verified in S42",
               status="verified")
db.insert_work_item("WI-001", title="Fix rate limiter",
                    origin="defect", component="infrastructure",
                    resolution_status="open",
                    changed_by="claude", change_reason="Found during S42 testing")
db.export_json()                           # Full logical backup
db.close()
```

---

## Step 2: Machine-Verifiable Assertions

This is the key innovation. Each specification can have JSON assertions that Claude can run automatically:

```python
# Three assertion types:
assertions = [
    # grep -- pattern must be found in file (with min_count)
    {"type": "grep", "file": "src/config.py", "pattern": "MAX_TURNS",
     "min_count": 1, "description": "Max turns constant defined"},

    # grep_absent -- pattern must NOT be found in file
    {"type": "grep_absent", "file": "src/wizard.py", "pattern": "DuplicateStepName",
     "description": "Wizard does not duplicate sidebar content"},

    # glob -- file path pattern must match at least one file
    {"type": "glob", "pattern": "admin/shared/HelpTooltip.tsx",
     "description": "HelpTooltip component exists"},
]
```

### Assertion Runner

The assertion runner (`assertions.py`) iterates all specs with assertions, runs each check, and records results in `assertion_runs`. It returns a structured summary:

```python
def run_all_assertions(db, triggered_by="manual"):
    """Run all assertions across all specs. Returns summary dict."""
    specs = db.list_specs_with_assertions()
    results = []
    for spec in specs:
        parsed = json.loads(spec["assertions"])
        checks = [run_single_assertion(a) for a in parsed]
        overall_passed = all(c["passed"] for c in checks)
        db.record_assertion_run(spec["id"], spec["version"],
                                overall_passed, checks, triggered_by)
        results.append({"spec_id": spec["id"], "title": spec["title"],
                        "overall_passed": overall_passed, "checks": checks})
    return {"passed": sum(1 for r in results if r["overall_passed"]),
            "failed": sum(1 for r in results if not r["overall_passed"]),
            "details": results}
```

### Why This Matters

Without assertions, Claude "believes" specs are implemented based on session memory. With assertions, Claude **proves** specs are implemented by checking the actual codebase. When a future code change accidentally breaks a behavior, the assertion catches it at session start.

---

## Step 3: Governance Principles

These governance principles evolved over 125+ sessions. They are not mandatory — adopt the ones that fit your project.

### GOV-01: Specs Are the Negotiation Artifact

When the human requests a change or identifies a flaw, Claude's first priority is creating/updating a specification. Testing and implementation proceed only after mutual understanding is established.

### GOV-02: Specs Are Immutable Without Owner Consent

Claude proposes; the human decides. Specifications are the shared contract between human and AI.

### GOV-03: Spec Granularity Is Driven by Test Unambiguity

Every spec should produce an unambiguous PASS/FAIL when tested. If a spec cannot be tested unambiguously, it needs to be decomposed.

### GOV-04: Specs Mature Through Use

Iterative refinement is normal maturation, not a defect. Specs start as `specified`, get `implemented`, then `verified`. Each transition creates a new version.

### GOV-05: Fix the Spec First, Not the Code

When a test fails, first verify the specification is correct. Then verify the test is correct. Only then fix the implementation. Correct the requirement before changing code.

### GOV-06: Specify on Contact

When Claude touches unspecified code, it becomes controlled. Any existing behavior that is modified should first be recorded as a specification.

### GOV-07: No Bug Fixes During Testing

Record defects as work items during test phases; fix them in separate sessions. This keeps testing phases clean and prevents scope creep.

### GOV-08: Knowledge Database Is the Single Source of Truth

All project knowledge lives in the KB. Markdown files store rules (CLAUDE.md) and operational state (MEMORY.md), but specifications, tests, procedures, and documents belong in the database.

### GOV-09: Owner Input Classification

When the owner describes what the system "must do," "should do," "must include," or states numbered criteria, classify the input as specification language. Before writing any code: (1) record or verify specifications in KB, (2) identify work items for any gaps, (3) add work items to the backlog, (4) present the backlog for prioritization. A `UserPromptSubmit` hook (`spec-classifier.py`) mechanically enforces this, but Claude must also self-enforce when the hook does not trigger.

### GOV-10: Tests Must Exercise Exposed Production Interfaces

Source inspection tests (reading code files to verify patterns) are regression supplements, not Test artifacts. Each Test artifact must produce PASS/FAIL against observable outcomes on live/staging systems. Tests are written and linked to specs before implementation.

### GOV-11: Design Decision Checkpoint Discipline

At each work item or phase completion boundary, Claude must review implementation decisions for spec coverage before proceeding. Batched checkpoint (at boundary), not real-time pause. This catches implementation decisions that should have been specifications but were not recorded in real time.

### The Specification Litmus Test

"Would a different choice affect the customer or the business?" If yes, it is a specification. If no, it is an implementation detail.

**IS a specification:** Intent taxonomy, tier pricing, conversation handling rules, privacy commitments, UI field inventory, integration choices, quality criteria.

**NOT a specification:** Database schema, middleware ordering, startup sequence, API response shapes, env vars, internal module structure.

---

## Step 4: Session Hooks

### SessionStart Hook — Assertion Check + Handoff Injection

Register in `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 .claude/hooks/assertion-check.py",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The hook does two things:
1. **Runs all assertions** and classifies failures as either "regressions" (implemented/verified specs now failing) or "expected" (specified but not yet implemented).
2. **Reads the session handoff prompt** stored by the previous session, so Claude automatically knows what to work on next.

```python
# Classification logic in the hook:
for failure in failures:
    spec = db.get_spec(failure["spec_id"])
    status = spec["status"]
    if status in ("implemented", "verified"):
        # REGRESSION -- something broke
        regressions.append(failure)
    else:
        # Expected -- not yet implemented
        expected.append(failure)
```

### UserPromptSubmit Hook — Specification Classifier (GOV-09)

The spec-classifier hook (`.claude/hooks/spec-classifier.py`) scans each user prompt for specification language — phrases like "must include," "should do," "ensure that," or numbered criteria. When detected, it injects a reminder to follow the spec-first workflow (GOV-09) before writing any code. This prevents Claude from jumping straight to implementation when the owner is actually defining requirements.

### UserPromptSubmit Hook — Session Scheduler

The scheduler hook (`.claude/hooks/scheduler.py`) processes pre-planned prompts from `.claude/SCHEDULE.md`. This enables deferred automation — Claude can schedule future tasks during a session that execute in subsequent sessions.

```markdown
<!-- .claude/SCHEDULE.md format -->
## Group: post-deploy-checks
trigger: always

Update staging deployment status in MEMORY.md after confirming revision is active.
```

**Trigger types:**
- `always` — inject with the next user prompt
- `session_end` — inject when wrap-up keywords are detected
- `after:N` — inject after N user prompts have been processed

The scheduler uses file locking to prevent race conditions when multiple hooks fire concurrently.

### Session Handoff Prompts

At the end of each session, Claude stores a structured prompt for the next session:

```python
db.insert_session_prompt("S42",
    prompt_text="Continue work on Feature X. Group 3 complete, "
        "start Group 4. 4,539 tests, 0 failures.",
    context={
        "production_version": "1.58.3",
        "test_count": 4539,
        "next_tasks": ["WI-243", "WI-244"]
    })
```

The next session's hook automatically retrieves and displays this, then marks it as consumed.

---

## Step 5: Audit Cadence

Every Nth session (default: 5) is automatically flagged as an **audit session**. During wrap-up, the handoff generator checks and prepends audit instructions:

```python
def is_audit_session(self, next_session_id, interval=None):
    n = self.parse_session_number(next_session_id)  # "S100" -> 100
    if n is None:
        return False
    return n % (interval or self.AUDIT_INTERVAL) == 0

def get_audit_directive(self):
    return (
        "AUDIT SESSION: Perform a fresh-context review before new work:\n"
        "1. Knowledge DB integrity -- run assertions, check for status drift\n"
        "2. MEMORY.md and CLAUDE.md -- accuracy, staleness, contradictions\n"
        "3. Repeatable Procedures -- still accurate?\n"
        "4. Open design debt -- TODOs, type safety, large files\n"
        "5. Hooks and scheduler -- verify all hooks execute without errors\n"
        "Report findings before proceeding with regular work."
    )
```

This compensates for the inevitable context drift that accumulates across sessions.

## Step 6: CLAUDE.md + MEMORY.md Boundary

The database does not replace your markdown files — it complements them:

| File | Role | Content | Updates |
|------|------|---------|---------|
| **CLAUDE.md** | Rules & behavior | How to work: procedures, mandates, evaluation criteria | Rarely — only when rules change |
| **MEMORY.md** | State & bootstrap | What has been done: versions, sessions, quick reference | Every session |
| **Knowledge DB** | Artifacts & assertions | Specifications, tests, work items, documents, procedures | Every code change |

**Rule of thumb:** If it tells Claude *what to do*, it goes in CLAUDE.md. If it tells Claude *what has been done* or *how to access something*, it goes in MEMORY.md. Formal artifacts with machine-verifiable truth go in the database.

**Anti-drift rules for CLAUDE.md:**
- All project knowledge lives in the KB — do not create new markdown files for project knowledge
- Permitted markdown: CLAUDE.md (rules), MEMORY.md + topic files (operational state), external-facing docs
- Topic files are Claude's operational memory, not the canonical source of truth

### CLAUDE.md Should Reference the DB

```markdown
### Knowledge Database
The Knowledge Database (`tools/knowledge-db/knowledge.db`) is the canonical
source of truth for all project artifacts. Claude is the sole writer. The owner
observes through the read-only web UI at localhost:8090.

Python API: `tools/knowledge-db/db.py`
  db.get_spec("SPEC-0245")
  db.insert_work_item(...)
  db.get_open_work_items()
  db.get_untested_specs()
  db.get_summary()
```

---

## Step 7: Read-Only Web UI

A simple Flask app provides the owner with visibility without giving them write access:

```python
# app.py -- ~260 lines, runs at localhost:8090
from flask import Flask, render_template_string
from db import KnowledgeDB

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def index():
    db = KnowledgeDB()
    summary = db.get_summary()
    specs = db.list_specs()
    db.close()
    return render_template_string(TEMPLATE, summary=summary, specs=specs)
```

The owner sees all artifacts, their statuses, assertion results, and version history. They tell Claude what to fix; Claude creates a corrected version.

---

## Step 8: Seed Script

Bootstrap the database from your existing project artifacts:

```python
# seed.py -- Run once to populate initial data
# IMPORTANT: Guard against accidental re-seeding
def main():
    db = KnowledgeDB()
    existing = db.get_summary()
    if existing["spec_total"] > 0 and "--force" not in sys.argv:
        print(f"Database already has {existing['spec_total']} specs. "
              "Use --force to re-seed.")
        sys.exit(1)

    # Load from whatever source you have (markdown backlog, JIRA export, etc.)
    for item in your_backlog:
        db.insert_spec(
            id=item["id"],
            title=item["title"],
            status="specified",
            changed_by="seed",
            change_reason="Initial import from backlog"
        )
    db.close()
```

## Recurring Instructions for CLAUDE.md

Add these to your CLAUDE.md so Claude maintains the database correctly across sessions:

```markdown
### Knowledge Database Maintenance

**Claude is the sole writer.** The owner observes through the read-only web UI.

**When to update the database:**

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Implement a feature | `update_spec(id, status="implemented", change_reason="...")` |
| Verify via tests | `update_spec(id, status="verified", change_reason="...")` |
| Discover a wrong status | `update_spec(id, status=corrected, change_reason="...")` |
| Find a defect | `insert_work_item(origin="defect", ...)` |
| Test reveals regression | `insert_work_item(origin="regression", ...)` |
| Complete a procedure | Create new version via `insert_op_procedure()` |

**Assertion rules:**
- Valid types: `grep`, `grep_absent`, `glob`
- Pass assertions as raw Python lists -- the API handles JSON serialization
- After adding new fields to schemas, update count assertions (test drift)
- Run assertions after every batch of changes

**Session wrap-up:** Store a handoff prompt via `db.insert_session_prompt()`
so the next session starts with context.

**Audit cadence:** Every 5th session performs a fresh-context integrity review
before new work.
```

---

## Lessons Learned (125+ Sessions)

1. **The assertion runner is the single most valuable piece.** It turns "Claude remembers" into "Claude proves." Regressions caught at session start save hours of debugging.

2. **Append-only is not a limitation, it is a feature.** We never need to worry about lost data. At ~20 KB/session, storage is a non-issue for any realistic project lifetime.

3. **The double-serialization trap is real.** `update_spec(assertions=json.dumps([...]))` will double-encode because the method already calls `json.dumps()`. Always pass raw Python objects.

4. **Test drift is the #1 recurring failure mode.** When you add fields, enums, or schema entries, count-based assertions break. The fix is mechanical but easy to forget. The assertion runner catches it immediately.

5. **Session handoff prompts eliminate cold-start friction.** Instead of the human crafting "Continue work on X..." prompts, the previous session stores exactly what the next one needs.

6. **The 5-session audit cadence catches accumulated drift.** Individual sessions maintain the DB well, but small errors compound. Periodic fresh-context reviews are essential.

7. **MEMORY.md and CLAUDE.md still matter.** The database stores formal artifacts and assertions. The markdown files store rules, preferences, and operational patterns that do not fit a relational model.

8. **The read-only web UI builds trust.** The owner sees everything Claude knows without needing to read code or run scripts. This transparency is crucial for long-running commercial projects.

9. **Use a sentinel for "not provided" vs "set to None."** A bare `None` check cannot distinguish "caller omitted this argument" from "caller explicitly set it to None." A module-level `_UNSET = object()` sentinel resolves the ambiguity in merge logic.

10. **Index early.** As the database grows past ~100 specs, queries on `status`, `id`, and `changed_at` benefit noticeably from indexes. Add them in the schema creation, not as an afterthought.

11. **Python method name shadowing is silent.** When a class defines two methods with the same name, the second silently replaces the first. No error raised. Always use unique helper names per table (e.g., `_next_test_proc_version` vs `_next_test_version`).

12. **Governance principles emerge from use.** Do not try to design all the rules upfront. Let them crystallize through real sessions. Our 11 governance principles were all discovered through actual failures, not anticipated.

13. **The orchestrating artifact principle prevents content duplication.** Test plans reference test IDs, backlogs reference work item IDs. Never duplicate artifact content inside another artifact — reference by ID and keep each artifact independently versioned.

14. **Specification types enable different behaviors.** Requirements, governance rules, and protected behaviors have different change frequencies and verification patterns. A `type` column lets you filter and handle them differently.

15. **Migrate topic files to the database.** Markdown topic files inevitably drift from reality. Migrating project knowledge into documents under change control catches contradictions and enables search across all knowledge.

16. **Mechanical specification enforcement beats self-enforcement.** A UserPromptSubmit hook that detects specification language ("must include," "should do") and injects a GOV-09 reminder catches cases where Claude would otherwise jump straight to coding. The hook cost zero maintenance after initial creation and has prevented several spec-first violations.

17. **Source inspection tests are not real tests.** Reading TypeScript source files with `Path.read_text()` and checking for string patterns is useful as a regression supplement but does not exercise the production interface. Distinguishing these from genuine Test artifacts (GOV-10) improved test plan credibility.

18. **Design decisions accumulate silently.** During implementation, Claude makes dozens of decisions per session (billing model, auth strategy, bypass logic) that affect customers but are never recorded as specifications. A batched checkpoint at work item boundaries (GOV-11) catches these before they become invisible commitments.
